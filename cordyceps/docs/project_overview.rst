Project description - review
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The project aims to develop an innovative solution to enhance efficiency and productivity within warehouse operations. 
By leveraging a fleet of autonomous robots, this project will revolutionize the way warehouses handle larger task that aren't suitable for single robots. For example palets that are too heavy for a single robot to carry.

The project will focus on designing and implementing a cohesive system that integrates multiple robots to perform a larger task together.

The key objective of the project is to streamline warehouse operations by optimizing the movement of goods and the use of robots. This will be achieved by developing a multi-robot system that can perform tasks as single robots or as a group. The system will be able to dynamically allocate tasks to individual robots based on their current location, availability, and capabilities. 
It will also be able to coordinate the movement of multiple robots to perform complex tasks that require collaboration.

The project will involve the following key components:

    * Robot Hardware

    * Software Development

    * Integration and Testing

    * Scalability and Adaptability: Designing the system to be scalable and adaptable, allowing for the addition of bigger tasks and more robots.


Scope - review
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is outside of the scope of the project to:
    * Develop a commercially viable product
    * Achieve specific performance marks
    * Provide training to use the system
    * Transporting a load from A to B
    * Integrate the system in any standardised robotics environment (e.g. OpenRMF)
    * The simultaneous control of multiple VS
    * Request virtual structures with a different number of members than robots available in the scenario
    * Perform the demonstrations in any other environment than the accorded one
    * Implementing a system capable of dealing with non pre-mapped environments
    * Account for dynamic obstacles
