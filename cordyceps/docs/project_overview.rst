Project description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The project is an aplied research project, which aims to develop a system capable of controlling a team of robots to perform a task. 
The system will be able to control the robots to form a virtual structure (VS) and transport a load from A to B. 
The aim of this project is to take an initial step into the realm of collaborative load transportation. 
Through research and experimentation, we will explore the most promising and feasible methods for creating virtual structure formations.
