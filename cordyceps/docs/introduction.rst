Introduction
------------
The increasing number of robots in various industries such as warehouses, farms, factories, and cleaning services is driving the need for a shift towards utilizing multiple small collaborative robots instead of large powerful ones. This approach offers several advantages including enhanced speed, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, reliability, and safety.

Multi Robot Systems (MRS) refer to groups of robots that work together to accomplish higher-level objectives. Implementing MRS effectively can transform the upgrade process for autonomous warehouses from expensive robot purchases to a simple downloadable file. A crucial aspect of many collaborative transportation systems is the ability to establish and maintain a formation.

The aim of this project is to take an initial step into the realm of collaborative load transportation. Through research and experimentation, we will explore the most promising and feasible methods for creating virtual structure formations. The expected outcome is a comprehensive documentation consisting of theoretical and practical knowledge, along with accompanying platforms, tools, and source code. These resources will facilitate future projects related to collaborative load transportation at Fontys.
